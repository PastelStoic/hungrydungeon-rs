All actors have the following stats:

- Health
- Attack
- Defense

These three alone are enough to hit parity with the current system - in the
future, I plan to upgrade these.

All abilities have some modifier to a characters stats that determines how
effective it is. An attack might have 100% accuracy and 50% power, using a
characters accuracy stat unmodified and half of their power stat.

Most actors have at least one organ. Organs have their own stats - attack,
defense, health, and capacity, the last of which is exclusive to organs.

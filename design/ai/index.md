All ai have a series of possible actions they can take, each of which has a way
of producing a ranking, either 0 (action should not be taken) or a positive
non-zero integer representing how strongly the ai wants to take the action.

Examples
- Basic attack. Requires the attack value of the attacking entity, as well as their Entity for possible retaliation.
